Vi har lavet tre betingelsesvariable, som vi antager implementeres ved
hjælp af køer. Hver af disse betingelsesvariable repræsenterer en kø,
barber-køen, sidde-køen og stå-køben.

Køerne fungerer altså ved at der bliver waited og
signaleret for at gå i kø og vække objekter fra køen.

Vi bruger en global tæller til at tælle hvor mange folk der er i sidde
og stå-køen.

Vi kan desværre ikke teste implementationen for 30 kunder, da den
statiske lager-allokering bruger for mange pages, og vi har ikke
implementeret G5. Vores program burde dog virke efter hensigten. Det
er testet med 20 kunder. Outputtet kan ses nedenfor.
